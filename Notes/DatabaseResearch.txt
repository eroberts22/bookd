Firebase vs SQLite

Firebase Firestore:
- Cloud service hosted by Google- server entirely separated from us
- Only free for a certain size: 
- Tons of services/ APIs/SDKs 
- Non-portable: Anything done in firebase will not translate elsewhere
- Easy to setup
- Lots of development resources
- Real Time Database has limited query filtering functinality
- 1GiB total stored data
- NoSQL database, using collections


SQLite:
- Self contained, serverless, no configuration, transactinoal SQL database engine
- Embedded SQL engine (hosted on own computer)
- Classic SQL functionality
- Lightweight
- Lots of development resources


Decision: SQLite
Reason: Offers standard SQL structure and functionality. Don't need anything crazy for this project
